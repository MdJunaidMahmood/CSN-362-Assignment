I have executed the Solution.cpp in Linux Operating System. In order to do that just use the following set of commands:
1) g++ Solution.cpp -o sol.out
2) cat input.txt | ./sol.out > output.txt 

Here input.txt and output.txt refers to the input and output file respectively. Sample execution of the program is demonstarted in "Sample_Run.png".

Solution.cpp prints whether any string is part of the language or not and gives the possible derivation corressponding to that string. For part(b) and part(c) of the problem, sample input has been given in the form of "aaabbb" and "aabbb" respectively.
"-1" must be entered as input string in order to terminate the program.

Following points are noteworthy:
1) Input String must consist of only three characters a, b and ^. The alphabet of the language is {a, b}. In case of any other character being present, the string would be considered invalid.

2) "^" is used for denoting an empty string and it would be accepted by the language generated by the grammar.

3) Every input string should start from new line. Leading and Trailing spaces are not considered part of the input string.

4) "input.txt" and "output.txt" contains sample input and output file.
